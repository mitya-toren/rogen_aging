        "This report summarizes the steps taken and the key findings from the analysis of the provided Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) gene lists, integrating data from NCBI, the Longevity Map database, and AlphaGenome predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Data Loading and Initial Processing\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis began by loading the initial AD and PD gene lists from the provided CSV files, which were originally extracted from an Excel file (`Supplementary Table 3.xlsx`). These lists categorize genes based on disease (AD or PD) and regulation status (upregulated or downregulated).\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Gene Information Retrieval from NCBI\n",
        "\n",
        "Detailed information for each gene in the provided lists was retrieved from the NCBI database using their Entrez IDs. This process aimed to enrich the gene list with:\n",
        "*   Gene Symbols\n",
        "*   Genomic Annotations (Location)\n",
        "*   Disease Association Studies/Summary\n",

        "\n",
        "## 3. Integration with Longevity Map Database\n",
        "\n",
        "The comprehensive gene list was then compared with genes and variants from the Longevity Map SQLite database (`longevitymap.sqlite`).\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Gene Overlap:** Genes present in both the user's AD/PD lists (identified by Entrez ID) and the Longevity Map database were identified. A total of **{len(overlapping_entrez_ids) if 'overlapping_entrez_ids' in globals() else 'N/A'}** overlapping genes were found based on Entrez ID.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Significant SNP Association:** Significant Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with these overlapping genes were extracted from the Longevity Map's `variant` table. A table (`overlapping_genes_with_snps_df`) was created to link the overlapping genes from your list with their associated significant longevity SNPs, including details like SNP location, study design, association type, and PubMed ID.\n",
        "\n",
        "    A total of **{len(overlapping_genes_with_snps_df) if 'overlapping_genes_with_snps_df' in globals() else 'N/A'}** significant SNPs were found to be associated with the overlapping genes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. AlphaGenome Analysis of Overlapping Genes with Significant SNPs\n",
        "\n",
        "AlphaGenome analysis was performed on the subset of genes from your list that were found to have significant associations in the Longevity Map database. The goal was to predict the effect of a variant at the SNP location on RNA-seq expression.\n",
        "\n",

        "*   The AlphaGenome model predicted RNA-seq values for both the reference and alternate alleles at the specified variant positions.\n",
        "*   The analysis results, including the predicted RNA-seq data, were added to the DataFrame.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately, the AlphaGenome analysis encountered some technical issues related to the function calls and data format expectations of the library, resulting in **{len(successful_filtered_analyses_df) if 'successful_filtered_analyses_df' in globals() else '0'}** successful analyses out of **{len(genes_for_alphagenome_analysis_df) if 'genes_for_alphagenome_analysis_df' in globals() else 'N/A'}** attempts. This prevented the generation of RNA-seq comparison plots for these genes.\n",

        "\n",
        "A final table (`correlated_analysis_df`) was generated, combining the original information from your AD/PD gene lists for the overlapping genes with the details of their associated significant longevity SNPs from the Longevity Map. This table provides a consolidated view of the genes from your list that have a known connection to longevity through significant SNP associations.\n",
        "\n",
        "This table contains **{len(correlated_analysis_df) if 'correlated_analysis_df' in globals() else 'N/A'}** rows, with each row representing an overlapping gene and its associated significant SNP. The table includes columns such as:\n",

        "\n",
        "This table was saved as `overlapping_genes_significant_snps_table.csv`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion and Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "You have successfully identified genes from your AD/PD lists that overlap with the Longevity Map database and are associated with significant longevity SNPs. The generated table provides a valuable resource for prioritizing genes for further investigation into their potential roles in both neurodegenerative diseases and longevity.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the AlphaGenome analysis faced technical difficulties, the primary goal of identifying and consolidating information on overlapping genes with significant longevity SNPs has been achieved.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Potential Next Steps:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Analyze the `overlapping_genes_significant_snps_table.csv`:** Examine the genes and SNPs in this table more closely. The provided PubMed IDs can be used to delve into the specific longevity studies.\n",
        "*   **Further investigate the biological function:** Explore the biological pathways and functions of the genes in the final table using other bioinformatics tools and databases.\n",
        "*   **Troubleshoot AlphaGenome analysis:** If desired, further debugging would be needed to resolve the issues encountered with the AlphaGenome `predict_variant` function to obtain the predicted RNA-seq expression changes. This might require consulting the AlphaGenome library's documentation or examples for the correct usage of the `Variant` object and `predict_variant` function."

This suggests an issue with how the `predict_variant` function was called. Looking at the AlphaGenome documentation or examples (which I would do in a real scenario, but cannot here), the `predict_variant` function likely expects keyword arguments for `interval`, `variant`, and `ontology_terms`, not positional arguments. I need to correct the call to `model.predict_variant` in the `analyze_gene_variant` function to use keyword arguments. After correcting the function, I need to re-run the entire analysis process for the overlapping genes, including loading the data, performing the corrected AlphaGenome analysis, and then filtering for successful results.\n",

ACC is a biotin-containing enzyme which catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, the rate-limiting step in fatty acid synthesis. There are two ACC forms, alpha and beta, encoded by two different genes. ACC-alpha is highly enriched in lipogenic tissues. The enzyme is under long term control at the transcriptional and translational levels and under short term regulation by the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of targeted serine residues and by allosteric transformation by citrate or palmitoyl-CoA. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants divergent in the 5' sequence and encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.

ACC is a biotin-containing enzyme which catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, the rate-limiting step in fatty acid synthesis. There are two ACC forms, alpha and beta, encoded by two different genes. ACC-alpha is highly enriched in lipogenic tissues. The enzyme is under long term control at the transcriptional and translational levels and under short term regulation by the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of targeted serine residues and by allosteric transformation by citrate or palmitoyl-CoA. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants divergent in the 5' sequence and encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.

This enzyme helps metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics, and functions in folate catabolism. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

The glycoside hydrolase 18 family of chitinases includes eight human family members. This gene encodes a glycoprotein member of the glycosyl hydrolase 18 family. The protein lacks chitinase activity and is secreted by activated macrophages, chondrocytes, neutrophils and synovial cells. The protein is thought to play a role in the process of inflammation and tissue remodeling.

ACC is a biotin-containing enzyme which catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, the rate-limiting step in fatty acid synthesis. There are two ACC forms, alpha and beta, encoded by two different genes. ACC-alpha is highly enriched in lipogenic tissues. The enzyme is under long term control at the transcriptional and translational levels and under short term regulation by the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of targeted serine residues and by allosteric transformation by citrate or palmitoyl-CoA. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants divergent in the 5' sequence and encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.
