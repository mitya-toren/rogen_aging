## Available Notebooks

### AlphaGenome.ipynb & AlphaGenome_updated.ipynb
Longevity gene analysis using AlphaGenome API to explore genes associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD). Includes network analysis and visualization.

### MethylationClocks.ipynb
**Methylation Clocks Analysis** - Explores epigenetic (DNA methylation) clocks for biological age prediction.

Features:
- Epigenetic clock validation plot comparing chronological vs DNAm age
- Performance metrics calculation (MAE, RMSE, R², correlation)
- Overview of notable epigenetic clocks (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, GrimAge, DunedinPACE)
- Foundation for integration with real methylation array data (450K/EPIC)
